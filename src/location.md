<p class="copy">September in Denver is typically a beautiful time of year in Colorado, with the leaves changing into Fall colors in the mountains and pleasant warm weather to enjoy in the city and surrounds.</p>

<h2 class="page-subheader">Accommodation</h2>

<p class="copy">Hotel room availability at this time of year in Denver is extremely limited, so we strongly recommend that attendees traveling out of town reserve their rooms at the Grand Hyatt as early as possible. We have reserved a room block at the Grand Hyatt, and negotiated a low conference discounted room rate of $199/night. Contact the hotel directly to make your room booking, and mention the conference to receive the discounted rate.</p>
