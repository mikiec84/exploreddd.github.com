      <p class="copy">Stefan is bad at drawing stuff. However, he thinks he can acquire domain knowledge by drawing Domain Stories. Stefan studied Software Engineering in Austria and has a PhD in computer science. Since 2005, he has been working for WPS – Workplace Solutions Ltd. In Hamburg. Stefan hops from one domain to the next, assisting people to figure out how software can help them to get their job done.</p>
      <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Talk Session</h2>
      <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">How Domain Storytelling shaped our view of bounded contexts</h2>
      <p class="copy">Co-presented with <a href="henning-schwentner.html">Henning Schwentner</a></p>
      <p class="copy">Domain Storytelling means that we bring together domain experts and developers. We let them tell us stories about their domain. While listening, we record the stories using a pictographic language. The experts can see immediately if we understand their story. After very few stories, we are able to talk about the people, tasks, tools, work items, and events in that domain.</p>
      <p class="copy">Henning and Stefan will demonstrate Domain Storytelling by re-enacting how they modeled ship maneuver planning in the port of Hamburg. You will see that Domain Stories show how people work together within and across contexts – and how unsuitable boundaries prevent people from working together. After all, bounded contexts should separate models, not people.</p>
      <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Hands On Session</h2>
      <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Master your domain with Domain Storytelling</h2>
      <p class="copy">Co-presented with <a href="henning-schwentner.html">Henning Schwentner</a></p>
      <p class="copy">When we want to apply DDD, we must first master the domain. In this hands-on session, we will show you how you can build up domain knowledge with Domain Storytelling. Domain Stories help us better understand a domain and to constitute ubiquitous language. Domain Storytelling means that we bring together domain experts and developers. We let them tell us stories about their domain. While listening, we record the stories using a pictographic language. The experts can see immediately if we understand their story. After very few stories, we are able to talk about the people, tasks, tools, work items, and events in that domain.</p>
