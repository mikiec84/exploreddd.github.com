      <p class="copy">We’ll understand service oriented architecture concepts, and DDD concepts such as bounded contexts and data ownership. We’ll apply those concepts to build a simple, yet fully functional, order management system. <a href="../workshops/microservices-done-right.html">Read more...</a></p>
      <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Talk Session</h2>
      <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Microservices and Distributed Monoliths</h2>
      <p class="copy">“Microservices should contain no more than 100 lines of code” … “Microservices are REST APIs that communicate with JSON” … Where did all these microservice recommendations come from? Without a microservices game plan, you may end up with a distributed monolith, with all the worst attributes of a monolithic system and all the complexity of distributed microservices as well. You might even wonder if you should be using microservices at all.</p>
      <p class="copy">In this session I'll provide a roadmap to microservices that avoid the pitfalls of coupling that slide toward the pit of distributed monoliths, and introduce basic tenets of ViewModel composition that allow you to stitch data from properly segregated microservices in your UI.</p>
      <p class="copy">Or maybe you'll just be convinced you don't need microservices after all.</p>
