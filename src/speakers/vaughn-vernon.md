    <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>
    <p class="copy">Vaughn is a veteran software craftsman, with more than 30 years of experience in software design, development, and architecture. He is a thought leader in simplifying software design and implementation using innovative methods. Vaughn is the author of the books "Implementing Domain-Driven Design" and "Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model", both published by Addison-Wesley. He has been applying the tenets of Domain-Driven Design since his Smalltalk domain modeling days in the early 1990s. Vaughn speaks and presents at conferences internationally, he consults, and has taught his IDDD Workshop around the globe to hundreds of developers. He is also the founder of for comprehension, an online training website.</p>

    <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Implementing Event-Oriented DDD</strong></h2>

    <p class="copy"></p>

    <p class="copy">This hands-on, code-prolific, DDD workshop will teach you the essentials of how to implement using the Domain-Driven Design approach. Students will first receive an overview of DDD's strategic and tactical design, including ways to develop a Ubiquitous Language within a Bounded Context, using both Event Storming and Specification by Example.</p>

    <p class="copy">Following this, teams of students will use these tools to reach a shared understanding of a Core Domain and Subdomains. Each team will present their "big picture" and "design level" direction and receive helpful feedback before the implementation begins. This step leads to a succession of strategic and tactical design learning and implementation steps with either Java or C#. Implementations may use Event Sourcing and traditional domain model persistence. The following will be your takeaways:</p>

    <ul class="copy-list">
      <li>Essential DDD, with strategic and tactical design, including developing a Ubiquitous Language in a Bounded Context</li>
      <li>Learn the basics of Event Storming using "big picture" and "design level" modeling</li>
      <li>Apply your storming results to actual implementations using Aggregates and Domain Events</li>
      <li>Use Domain Events to integrate with multiple Bounded Contexts</li>
      <li>The tradeoffs of using traditional domain model persistence and Event Sourcing</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="copy">Understand that the better part of two days will be spent implementing using Java or C#. This is not a workshop for juniors, and at least 5-10 years of programming experience is recommended. You are required to supply your own computer, programming environment with build and test facilities that you use regularly, and your thinking cap.</p>

    <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Reactive DDD - Modeling Uncertainty</strong></h2>

    <p class="copy">Using the foundational ideals provided by Eric Evans, including the Bounded Context, Ubiquitous Language, Context Mapping, and business-driven modeling, this talk explores modeling uncertainty. Systems today are far more likely to be distributed, especially due to the ever increasing popularity of the cloud and microservices. Systems are also increasingly asynchronous, event-driven, and reactive. In the face of these and other influencing conditions, a pertinent question is, how can DDD be even more relevant today than when it was first explained? This talk addresses the current industry competing forces, and how the uncertainty introduced by vastly distributed systems can be finessed into highly functioning, business-centric systems, that teams can design, develop, and reason about.</p>
