    <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Error Elimination as a Design Driver</h2>
    <p class="copy">As developers we spend a lot of time dealing with error cases. We write code to handle them or leverage our type systems prevent them. These are fine strategies, but they don't cut to the core question. Why do the error cases exist at all? Can we get right of them? In this keynote, Michael Feathers will explore the idea that error cases are often missed design opportunities. </p>

    <p class="copy">Test Driven Development and Refactoring are powerful tools. With them you can add new code to systems and make existing code more maintainable. However, refactoring code without having tests in place can be hazardous. This class presents a collection of dependency breaking and test writing techniques that can be used to get existing code safely under test for refactoring. These techniques can be used in conjunction with Test Driven Development to breathe new life into large existing code bases. This class is structured as a set of lectures, discussions, and hands on exercises. <a href="../workshops/working-effectively-with-legacy-code.html">Read more...</a></p>
