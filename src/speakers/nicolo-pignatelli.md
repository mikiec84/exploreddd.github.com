      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>
      <p class="copy">Nicolò is Director of Engineering at GFG eCommerce Technologies, a fashion-tech solution provider based in Berlin. Software developer and hard core fan of Agile Management and Domain Drive Design, he spends his professional life in the twilight zone located in the middle of software, psychology, complexity thinking, the search for happiness, dürum and espresso. He loves to answer "it depends" to look smart and make himself hated. He usually says unpopular things and dreams of conquering the world to ban pizza Hawaii forever.</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Metaphor Driven Design</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Metaphors are everywhere. In our life, in our job and even in our source code.</p>

      <p class="copy">We are unconsciously driven by them when shaping our vision and understanding of the world. For a domain driven designed project to be successful, carefully choosing the right metaphors to describe our models, creating a shared understanding and a common interpretation of the systems at stake is therefore crucial.</p>

      <p class="copy">In this talk, we'll talk about the dangers that we face when our design process is unconsciously driven by metaphors; we’ll also see how bringing metaphors to a conscious level and dominating them, enables us to gain faster insights on our models, communicate those insights effectively and dramatically improve our ubiquitous language.</p>

      <p class="copy">By the way, did you notice? This description contains not less than 13 metaphors.</p>
