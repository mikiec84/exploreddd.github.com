        <p class="copy">Domain-Driven Design can be described as an approach that enables software experts to collaborate with domain experts to create solutions to real problems. This raises the question: what does it take to be considered an expert? Assertions have been made that there is no such thing as a "domain expert." While this is going a bit too far, it's certainly true that there is no single person with complete knowledge of any domain. Additionally, software professionals often have deficiencies - both real and imagined and/or self-imposed.</p>
        <p class="copy">In this session, we'll explore what it means to be an expert, in the domain of a given problem, in software development itself, and in Domain-Driven Design. We'll discuss the fortune in having excellent domain experts and strategies for dealing with situations without.</p>
