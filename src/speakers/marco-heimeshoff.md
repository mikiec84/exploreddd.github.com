      <p class="copy">Marco Heimeshoff is a trainer, coach and software developer from Germany. He co-organizes KanDDDinsky, a conference about the art of business software and founded the German DDD community in 2013.  Marco Heimeshoff has an unhealty relationship with Domain Driven Design, and won't leave any stone unturned once you lend him an ear and sticky notes.</p>
      <p class="copy">He believes that life long learning, focus on language and empathy are the three pillars of quality development. Frustration about the same old methods of working together and developing solutions lead him to Domain Driven Design, agile software development, functional programming and CQRS with event sourcing. With ten years of experience in these topics he helps teams to change and learn in all things from code to culture.</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Software Development is Not About Software</h2>
      <p class="copy">We build software that changes the world. From optimizing small companies to connecting humans and businesses on a global scale, our work plays a hidden but major role. Software development is not about software, it is about understanding the customers domain and solving their problems. We need a culture, a way of thinking about the needs of the customers first and putting an emphasis on their language and human interactions. If we let the domain drive our design, we can tackle complexity in the heart of software. The pillars of Domain Driven Design are learning, language and empathy. With the right mindset it becomes simple to derive good models, keep them pure and aligned with the business. Let's explore how to use Domain Driven Design to transform everything in your organisation: code, culture, agile and architecture.</p>
