        <p>Janelle is author of Idea Flow, a data-driven approach to measuring the “friction” in developer experience, and making improvement decisions with science rather than gut feel. After a 17-year career as a developer, consultant, and CTO specialized in statistical process control, data supply chain, and the art of mentorship, she is now a full-time entrepreneur, building the meta tooling platform of her dreams.</p>

        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Anatomy of Communication</h2>
        <p>In it's essence, DDD is a philosophy and set of techniques for constructing a shared mental model of a system, and translating it into software. Ideally, we want conversations with other humans, and conversations with our code, to have the highest possible bandwidth. Every major problem in software development boils down to communication.
        <p>What if we enabled a dialog around the challenges, by first deconstructing the Anatomy of Communication itself using our same DDD techniques</p> 
        <p>First, we'll start with a familiar system metaphor to give us the structure: a Network.</p>
        <p>Imagine everyone on your team, and the software itself, are all connected by wires in a Network. Along each of these wires is a Flow of Ideas. Ideas can flow between humans, or between humans and the software. In the context of an Idea Flow Network, software is a medium for ideas.</p> 
        <p>From here, we can start to describe the dynamics of an Idea Flow Network in terms of Friction and Flow. We can invent new words, extend the models, and have dialogs about the nature of communication pain -- all with our newly invented Ubiquitous Language!</p>
        <p>In this session, we'll combine our DDD skills with cognitive science research, to bring clarity and insight to this wordless space.</p>
