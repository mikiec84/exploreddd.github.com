      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Scott Bellware works with development teams on monolith remediation and autonomous services projects. He’s been on a five-year mission to incorporate all the good things he’s learned in the distributed systems world with all the good things he’s learned in the web development world. He's been coding professionally for twenty-five years, has held every position in a software organization from QA to CTO, and worked in a variety of languages, frameworks, and platforms. Scott is a contributor to the Eventide toolkit for event-sourced autonomous services.</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>The Aggregate, The Cohesion, and The Cargo Cult: Rise and Fall of Critical Thinking in DDD</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Since its introduction in 2003, Domain-Driven Design patterns have had a history of cargo-cult implementations, from DDD Light to implementing an entire bounded context as a single class. This presentation isn’t a definitive history of all of the questionable things that have been done in the name of DDD, but it points out particular characteristics and causes of cargo cult thinking in geek culture, and recasts “geek” as a chief cause of long-lived software mistakes, rather than an identity to be venerated.</p>
