      <p class="copy">Allard Buijze is Chief Technical Officer at Trifork Amsterdam. As a member of the management team Allard is responsible for Trifork's ability to translate clients' business challenges into pioneering technical strategies and solutions. Allard is client-oriented and actively involved in helping customers reach appropriate future-proof, technical decisions.</p>

      <p class="copy">Allard brings a vast amount of knowledge and experience to this role. As a former software architect specializing within the field of "scalability" and "performance", he has worked on several small and large projects, where performance is often a recurring theme. Allard is convinced that a good domain model is the beginning of contributing to the overall performance of an application. From this conviction, he has developed the Axon Framework. He regularly gives workshops and trainings in frameworks, best practices and architecture. He also regularly speaks at conferences, seminars and meet-ups.Allard Buijze is Chief Technical Officer at Trifork Amsterdam.

        <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Bringing your model to life with Axon Framework</strong></h2>

        <p class="copy">Putting thought in models is important and, to some extent, inevitable. However, modelling brings no value if it doesn't make it to production.</p>

        <p class="copy">In this "no slides, just code" talk, we going to take a hands-on approach to getting our model to work. We'll not only be focusing on the model itself, but also how to organize it to allow for maximum scalability and performance. You will see how the proper separation of 'business logic' and 'infrastructure' allows for a pragmatic approach to microservices: monolith-first.</p>

        <p class="copy">While the coding is done in Java (and a bit of Kotlin) with Axon Framework, the concepts apply to other languages as well. Putting thought in models is important and, to some extent, inevitable. However, modelling brings no value if it doesn't make it to production.</p>
