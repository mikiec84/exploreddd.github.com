      <p class="copy">Allard Buijze is Founder and CTO of AxonIQ. Starting at the age of 6, he has developed a great passion for programming and has guided both large and small organizations in building performant and scalable applications. Now, he is on a mission to make implementations of large scale systems easier, using the concepts of Domain Driven Design, Command-Query Responsibility Segregation and Event Driven Architectures.</p>

      <p class="copy">Strategic design does not stop at defining boundaries around business capabilities - it should reach out for truly smart endpoints, emphasize autonomy and the need for more coarse-grained and asynchronous APIs. The long-running services behind such APIs feel responsible for their business and sort out most problems without leaking internal troubles and bothering their clients. While long-running services will leverage domain events for decoupling, they will often expose their core functions as commands - in order to minimise overall coupling! Extracting the customer-facing core processes of companies into dedicated, long-running services allows to keep sight of larger-scale flows - without violating bounded contexts or introducing god services. In this talk, Martin not only explores strategic design in the light of understanding the long-running nature of delivering many real-life business capabilities. He will also show the practical side of the equation: implementing long-running behaviour of services, requiring proper reactions on failures, timeouts and the compensating actions sagas are known for. A new generation of lightweight, embeddable and scalable saga managers and flow engines assist in that endeavour. Expect real-life experience and many examples! <a href="../workshops/event-driven-microservices-with-axon-framework.html">Read more...</a></p>
