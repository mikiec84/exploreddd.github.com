      <p class="copy">Allard Buijze is Chief Technical Officer at Trifork Amsterdam. As a member of the management team Allard is responsible for Trifork's ability to translate clients' business challenges into pioneering technical strategies and solutions. Allard is client-oriented and actively involved in helping customers reach appropriate future-proof, technical decisions.</p>

      <p class="copy">Allard brings a vast amount of knowledge and experience to this role. As a former software architect specializing within the field of "scalability" and "performance", he has worked on several small and large projects, where performance is often a recurring theme. Allard is convinced that a good domain model is the beginning of contributing to the overall performance of an application. From this conviction, he has developed the Axon Framework. He regularly gives workshops and trainings in frameworks, best practices and architecture. He also regularly speaks at conferences, seminars and meet-ups.

      <h2 class="conference-emphasis">Talk Session</h2>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Pragmatic Event-Driven (Micro)Services</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Most discussions about the implementation of a new system or component (especially when considering a microservices based architecture) start by evaluating the various technical options and challenges that they come with. However, the real business value isn’t in these technical choices, but in the functionality. While the use of frameworks seems to trigger some controversy in the DDD community, they can provide great value in separating the functional aspects from the technology.</p>

      <p class="copy">In this session, Allard Buijze will share the lessons he has learned on DDD (and CQRS) while building Axon Framework. How can a framework help developers build better software, faster. Why do certain frameworks fail, and take you down with them? How can a framework promote, instead of inhibiting, the use of a good model?Most discussions about the implementation of a new system or component (especially when considering a microservices based architecture) start by evaluating the various technical options and challenges that they come with.

      <p class="copy">The only true measurement of progress is software in production." So let's get our models to production!</p>

      <p class="copy">"In this workshop, we're going hands-on with Axon Framework, a framework for building event driven microservices on the JVM, to build Event Driven microservices based on the principles of DDD and CQRS. You will learn how to quickly set up an application and get started with the domain logic immediately. We will implement some fun domain logic and run our applications in a clustered setup together (if network allows)."The only true measurement of progress is software in production."
