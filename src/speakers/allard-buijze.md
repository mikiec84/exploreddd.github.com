      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Allard Buijze is Founder and CTO of AxonIQ. Starting at the age of 6, he has developed a great passion for programming and has guided both large and small organizations in building performant and scalable applications. Now, he is on a mission to make implementations of large scale systems easier, using the concepts of Domain Driven Design, Command-Query Responsibility Segregation and Event Driven Architectures. He created Axon Framework as an experiment initially, but when both large and organizations started using Axon as a solution to their complexity problems, AxonIQ was born.</p>

      <p class="copy">Through his conviction that good craftsmanship can only be achieved through continuous and intensive exchange of experience with others, Allard is a frequent speaker at conferences and meetups and enjoys giving trainings to fellow developers and architects. Allard is also regularly found in board rooms, explaining the concepts and values of DDD, CQRS and EDA to C-level executives.</p>

      <h2 class="conference-emphasis">Talk Session</h2>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Pragmatic Event-Driven (Micro)Services</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Most discussions about the implementation of a new system or component (especially when considering a microservices based architecture) start by evaluating the various technical options and challenges that they come with. However, the real business value isn’t in these technical choices, but in the functionality. While the use of frameworks seems to trigger some controversy in the DDD community, they can provide great value in separating the functional aspects from the technology.</p>

      <p class="copy">In this session, Allard Buijze will share the lessons he has learned on DDD (and CQRS) while building Axon Framework. How can a framework help developers build better software, faster. Why do certain frameworks fail, and take you down with them? How can a framework promote, instead of inhibiting, the use of a good model?Most discussions about the implementation of a new system or component (especially when considering a microservices based architecture) start by evaluating the various technical options and challenges that they come with.

      <p class="copy">The only true measurement of progress is software in production." So let's get our models to production!</p>

      <p class="copy">"In this workshop, we're going hands-on with Axon Framework, a framework for building event driven microservices on the JVM, to build Event Driven microservices based on the principles of DDD and CQRS. You will learn how to quickly set up an application and get started with the domain logic immediately. We will implement some fun domain logic and run our applications in a clustered setup together (if network allows)."The only true measurement of progress is software in production."
