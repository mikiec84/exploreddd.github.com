        <p>James was first introduced to Domain Driven Design by a fellow student and later mentor. Since being bitten by the bug, he has found himself to be every bit an impassioned DDDer.</p>
        <p>James is currently a Software Engineer Senior 2 for Nordstrom and lives in Colorado.</p>
        <h2>Talk Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Accelerated Learning with Rapid Prototypes and DSLs</h2>
        <p>Co-presented with <a href="josh-maletz.html">Josh Maletz</a></p>
        <p>You have created a story map with your business partners and defined an MVP. Your development team has started discussing architecture and how the system might evolve. You define spikes to answer some questions and validate your assumptions. How long does it take to build the walking skeleton and validate your spikes? Is your system designed to be able to give you the answers you need to see if the desired outcome has been attained? Are the models used to build the solution space useful? Is the resulting architecture effective? Does it bend?</p>
        <p>This talk, targeted at all development team members, will provide methods for creating rapid prototypes of even complex systems to explore how useful the models are and how effective your architecture is. We will show how to use Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), templates, and code generation to rapidly create prototypes and test systems to enable accelerated learning.</p>
