        <p class="copy">DDD is more than just aggregates, entities, and value objects! In fact, many of the most powerful aspects of DDD go overlooked when teams begin refactoring their monoliths. This talk will provide conceptual tools that can help you carve your team's domain from a ball of mud while leaving your monolith intact. We'll focus on a few key design tactics while working through a simple refactoring of a classic anemic service.</p>
