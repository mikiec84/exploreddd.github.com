      <p class="copy">Co-organizer of the DDD Paris user group, Thomas is an eXtreme Programmer & technical architect obsessed by use cases (Vs. solution-driven approaches). He likes using DDD & TDD to boost his efficiency at work. Advocating the advantages of the Hexagonal architecture since many years (talks, blogposts...), Thomas has recently live-coded with Alistair Cockburn on that topic.</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>How to distill the core domain from your legacy app</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy"><strong>Co-facilitated with <a href="bruno-boucard.html">Bruno Boucard</a></strong></p>

      <p class="copy">Letâ€™s take a very common legacy application: procedural code everywhere, anemic domain logic fully entangled with technical concerns and code. Nothing but classical stuff, right? Our mission for this session will be to identify and extract the core domain logic out of this tar pit in order to fix a bug that has cost our business money for months. While we will live-code, we will focus and explain some of the DDD tactical patterns we will use in the process.</p>

      <p class="copy">Last but not least, we will clean the situation for the years to come by properly splitting the domain code from the technical using the Hexagonal Architecture pattern.</p>
