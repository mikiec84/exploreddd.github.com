      <h2 class="speaker-keynote"><strong>Keynote - Friday, Sept. 22</strong></h2>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Observation of Emergent Schema in Organized Development</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">The original wiki was founded to understand engineering at a social level, first within one company and then more broadly around the world. We asked not for advice but for personal experience, what parts worked and why.</p>

      <p class="copy">The agile methods incubated in wiki have enabled a pace and scale of development unimaginable at its founding. Now, situated within rapid development, we have found a new way to observe and understand software and the people who make it.</p>

      <p class="copy">In this keynote we describe our methods, similar to data warehousing, but with the same interests as the original wiki. Our system captures from existing data a broad picture of what has been built and puts this in service of its continuing evolution.</p>
