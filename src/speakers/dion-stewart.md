        <p class="copy">Dion Stewart is a coach, mentor, developer, and international speaker. He helps organizations improve their product delivery value streams, addressing practices from product discovery through DevOps. For the last few years he has helped organizations bootstrap Dojos and implement “Project to Product” transformations, often combining the two.</p>
        <p class="copy">He enjoys working in situations where he is able to combine his interests in learning models, organizational change, and product development.</p>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Driving Domain-Driven Design with User Story Mapping</h2>
        <p class="copy">In his book User Story Mapping: Discover the Whole Story, Build the Right Product, Jeff Patton explains how to write better stories by creating story maps. Story maps foster better collaboration within and across teams, leading to shared understanding about the product.</p>
        <p class="copy">Dion Stewart learned story mapping from Jeff Patton and David Hussman six years ago. After using story mapping on a product as a developer, he was hooked. As a coach, Dion has taught story mapping to dozens of organizations. Along the way, story mapping has evolved.</p>
        <p class="copy">Dion explores how teams are using annotated journeys with story maps to drive modeling discussions around testing, ensuring outcomes and key results can be met, and how annotated journeys have most recently been used in applying domain driven design.</p>
        <p class="copy">Topics include:</p>
        <ul class="copy-list">
            <li>Story mapping basics</li>
            <li>User journeys</li>
            <li>Annotations for testing </li>
            <li>Ensuring outcomes/key results are measurable</li>
            <li>Using user journeys to drive collaboration around DDD concepts (ubiquitous language, defining the domain aggregates and entities, evolving the model, and establishing bounded contexts)</li>
            <li>Understanding the rate at which data changes over time</li>
        </ul>
