        <p class="copy">Dion Stewart is a coach, mentor, developer, and international speaker. He helps organizations improve their product delivery value streams, addressing practices from product discovery through DevOps. For the last few years he has helped organizations bootstrap Dojos and implement “Project to Product” transformations, often combining the two.</p>
        <p class="copy">He enjoys working in situations where he is able to combine his interests in learning models, organizational change, and product development.</p>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader">2-day pre-conference workshop, Tue-Wed, Sept 17-18</h2>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><a href="../workshops/product-discovery-product-framing-and-product-delivery.html">Product Discovery, Product Framing and Product Delivery</a></h2>
        <p class="copy">This workshop immerses the students in the practices of Product Discovery, Product Framing, and Product Delivery. The content is based on fifteen years of practice with roots in agile and lean methods and Domain-Driven Design. It also covers modern practices in the areas of product discovery, design sprints, and OKRs (outcomes and key results). <a href="../workshops/product-discovery-product-framing-and-product-delivery.html">Read more...</a></p>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Driving Domain-Driven Design with User Story Mapping</h2>
        <p class="copy">In his book “User Story Mapping: Discover the Whole Story, Build the Right Product” Jeff Patton explains how to write better stories by creating story maps. Story maps foster better collaboration within and across teams, leading to shared understanding about the product.</p>
        <p class="copy">In 2003, Eric Evans released his book “Domain-Driven Design”. DDD is experiencing a resurgence in popularity in recent years, largely due to its natural fit for cloud and microservice architectures.</p>
        <p class="copy">Dion Stewart learned story mapping from Jeff Patton and David Hussman six years ago. He's also been practicing domain-driven design since 2003. Over the past few years he has been combining Story Mapping with the tactical and strategic patterns from DDD.</p>
        <p class="copy">Dion explores how teams are using annotated journeys with story maps to link Product Discovery with Product Delivery. You'll leave this session knowing how to use Story Mapping in your own Product Discovery efforts. In addition, you'll understand how to use the story maps to drive domain model design. By combining Story Mapping with Domain-Driven Design you'll ensure product design, architecture, development, and testing are all based on the same shared understanding of the problem and solution space.</p>
        <p class="copy">Topics include:</p>
        <ul class="copy-list">
            <li>Story mapping basics</li>
            <li>User journeys</li>
            <li>Annotations for testing </li>
            <li>Ensuring outcomes and key results are measurable</li>
            <li>Using user journeys to drive collaboration and implement DDD patterns (ubiquitous language, establishing the core domain, subdomains, and bounded contexts, identifying aggregates, entities, and values, and defining domain events and commands)</li>
