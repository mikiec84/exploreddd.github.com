      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Tackling Complexity in Large-Scale Marketing Systems</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Turns out Domain-Driven Design works not only for cargo shipping. In this session I’d like to share the story of Plexop. Plexop is a large-scale marketing system that spans over a dozen of different business domains - from management of advertising spaces to sales agents’ commissions. To implement Plexop we had very limited resources and a very short time to market. That’s why we embraced Domain-Driven Design from day one, and boy did it pay out.

      <p class="copy">I will show how DDD allowed us to manage complexities, talk on different strategies for defining context boundaries that we’ve used, and of course, the things that we have learned the hard way - by making our own mistakes.<p>
