        <p class="copy">During a digital transformation, your legacy applications and platforms can shackle you to the past, prohibiting innovation and wasting money. We know that you cannot simply turn your back on your legacy IT and lose all of your historical data and undocumented business processes; you still need them in your portfolio.</p>
        <p class="copy">Business domain modeling with DDD is critical to understanding the business realm, map your legacy systems and charter the course to dynamic operations, breaking the application monoliths along the way. Based on years of experience in technology advisory, we will explore how DDD works in the brown field projects and products, to showcase that it delivers the true economic value to the business.</p>
