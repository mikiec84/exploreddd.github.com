    <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold"><a href="../workshops/essential-ddd.html">ESSENTIAL DDD</a></h2>
    <p class="copy">It’s easy to get lost in the patterns and acronyms and miss the essence of DDD. This workshop will provide you with a solid grounding in the foundational ideas, techniques and skills for doing DDD well in your own project context. The workshop is very hands-on and interactive, will help you connect everything in DDD together and see how it fits and what's most important, and give you practical tools to take away and try on your project. <a href="../workshops/essential-ddd.html">Read more...</a></p>
    <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Talk Session</h2>
      <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Modeling Team Flow</h2>
      <p class="copy">Don Reinertsen says, “The enemy of flow is the invisible and unmeasured queues that undermine all aspects of product development performance.” But how can we fight an invisible enemy? Most development teams remain blissfully unaware of the negative impact of these invisible queues on their productivity, or how to deal with them effectively.</p>
      <p class="copy">This talk focuses on modeling the presence and the negative impact of these invisible queues in the work of real teams. In this session, you’ll see how to use EventStorming to model the current state of team flow, and a live demo of visualizing and troubleshooting team development queues as timelines with Flow. We’ll talk about the power of metaphor and domain modeling to transform how teams visualize and improve their productivity.</p>
