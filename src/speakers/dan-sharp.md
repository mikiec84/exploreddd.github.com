      <p class="copy">Dan is a life-long geek, having been fascinated with computers since early childhood. He cut his teeth, like many, on Java and PHP, but found Ruby via Ruby on Rails in 2005, building one of the first successful Rails-based SaaS ventures and never looked back. These days, Dan works as Senior Software Architect with the Nexiaâ„¢ team at Ingersoll Rand, affording him the luxury of a startup environment backed by a multi-billion dollar company. He resides in Erie, CO with his wife and two children. When not hacking code, he's usually lost in the back country somewhere, enjoying the great outdoors.</p>
