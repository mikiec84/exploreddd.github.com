        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Mapping The Domain Vision</h2>
        <p class="copy">Way down in the depths of the big blue book there are 2 pages that are dedicated to describing the vision of the domain that is under development. Little has been written on the domain vision statement in the past 15 years even though it is a vital piece of information that enables teams to understand the motivation behind the investment in the domain and is key to ensuring teams are on the same page.</p>
        <p class="copy">In this talk we will explore ways to understand the motivation behind a system under development at a deeper level. Weâ€™ll look at domain-driven IT strategy, patterns for transitioning from an order taker to problem solver, a little bit of enterprise architecture, and much more as we become more skilled at identifying core domains.</p>
