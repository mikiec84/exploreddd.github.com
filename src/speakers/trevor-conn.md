      <p class="copy">Trevor has been developing internet-related software for over 20 years, mostly in the e-commerce space. More recently, his projects have included distributed, reactive systems. Where possible, he strives to use DDD principles to create and extend these systems which frequently requires untangling anti-patterns both within the code and the organization.</p>
      <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Talk Session</h2>
      <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">DDDecomposing the Monolith -- A personal anecdote.</h2>
      <p class="copy">In this talk I would like to present the challenges my organization faced as we sought to decompose and refactor a mature monolith according to DDD principles. These challenges span the gamut including infrastructure, organization, developer maturity and management. Ultimately, we were not successful and I believe our story can provide concrete warning signs for others who may seek to undertake such an effort enthusiastically but perhaps naively, especially within huge organizations. I will not be covering code in this talk. I think the best audience will be team leads, architects and/or product owners.</p>
