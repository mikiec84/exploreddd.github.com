        <h2>Talk Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">What CQRS and Event Sourcing taught me about DDD</h2>
        <p>CQRS and DDD are concepts that can be used completely independent of each other. They are also known for reinforcing each other. In my case, applying CQRS has significantly improved my understanding of Domain Driven Design, allowing me to write more cohesive and less coupled code and provide better techniques for discovering boundaries in contexts.</p>
        <p>In this presentation, we go through some of the specific elements from how we applied CQRS, and how each of them has an impact on how my colleagues and myself improved our outcome.</p>
