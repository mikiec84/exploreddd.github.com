        <p class="copy">Many organizations are operating in a very uncertain and volatile environment, so-called VUCA world. That means that product strategy evolves with time and can’t be top-down even if it’s brilliant. But how can we adapt to changing strategy on the organizational level and experiment with our hypotheses on a daily basis? The answer is by organizing our teams around customer success, e.g. becoming outcome-oriented. In this talk, we will learn how to organize to become outcome-oriented, what outcome-oriented teams have in common, and what kind of leadership is needed to support the teams in this transformation.</p>
