        <p class="copy">Josh loves all things software related. It is his favorite medium for solving problems, and while he'd rather not write more code if not needed, he relishes the opportunity when called for.</p>
        <p class="copy">Josh is a co-organizer of the Denver DDD Meetup and likes to share his experiences with and learn from the community.</p>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Talk Session</h2>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Accelerated Learning with Rapid Prototypes and DSLs</h2>
        <p class="copy">Co-presented with <a href="james-brayton.html">James Brayton</a></p>
        <p class="copy">You have created a story map with your business partners and defined an MVP. Your development team has started discussing architecture and how the system might evolve. You define spikes to answer some questions and validate your assumptions. How long does it take to build the walking skeleton and validate your spikes? Is your system designed to be able to give you the answers you need to see if the desired outcome has been attained? Are the models used to build the solution space useful? Is the resulting architecture effective? Does it bend?</p>
        <p class="copy">This talk, targeted at all development team members, will provide methods for creating rapid prototypes of even complex systems to explore how useful the models are and how effective your architecture is. We will show how to use Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), templates, and code generation to rapidly create prototypes and test systems to enable accelerated learning.</p>
