        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Find the Common Language Between Business and IT!</h2>
        <p class="copy">You must know that putting together a good IT strategy is not easy. One of the key components of the strategy is business capabilities as they have the potential to serve as a common language between business and IT. But how exactly can we know about these capabilities? Well, you need to start at the very beginning with the most important part: the business model.
        <p class="copy">In this session you will learn how to focus on the core (and real!) business needs (by using the very powerful Business Model Canvas) and business capabilities when you are putting an IT strategy together. Also, you will definitely learn about business capabilities themselves, what those are and how to visualize and map them.</p>
