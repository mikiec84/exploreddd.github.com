        <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Modelling Investment Banking</h2>
        <p class="copy">Have you ever wondered how the Investment Banking world works? Or what the domain flows are? Now you have the chance, by modelling the domain hands-on with an investment banking domain expert, Zs贸fia. Working in an unknown domain will improve your ability to model new domains and add new patterns and heuristics to your toolbox. This very interactive, collaborative session will not just teach you Investment Banking, but shows you how skills like EventStorming can be used on a daily basis when you are shaping the organisation and looking for bounded contexts. You will also see how the same domain can be modelled in different ways, providing different viewpoints of a system.</p>
