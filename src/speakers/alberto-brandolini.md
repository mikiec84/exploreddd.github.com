      <h2 class="speaker-subheader">biography</h2>
      <p class="copy">Alberto Brandolini can model every business domain, given enough space, a paper roll and an unlimited source of colored sticky notes (with a larger stock of orange ones). His contributions to the community include EventStorming, Model Storming and, more notably, the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle.</p>

      <p class="copy">Alberto Brandolini is an IT Professional that gets bored doing things in the same old way. This led him into unexplored areas of Domain-Driven Design, Lean and Agile Software Development, learning and change management, where he likes to bring apparent chaotic fuzziness and a comic-like visual touch. An active consultant in software product development, he also run his company Avanscoperta.</p>

      <p class="copy">He’s frequently invited as a clown speaker in many conferences in Italy (where he’s based) and around Europe.</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader">talk</h2>
      <p class="copy">There is no "one way" to solve problems in DDD. But there is an obsession in understand the true nature of that specific problems. This needs focus, clarity precision and attention to details. Unfortunately this doesn't fit the "do you have some code samples?" pattern of most mailing lists.</p>

      <p class="copy">Exploring a complex business domain starting from domain events. This is powerful and fun and could lead to better software, better business and better companies too.</p>
