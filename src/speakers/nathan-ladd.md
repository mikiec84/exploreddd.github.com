      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Nathan Ladd has been writing software professionally for over 10
years, specializing in domain driven design, architecture, and systems
engineering. He works primarily in Ruby, C, and Javascript. He started
his career as an embedded systems engineer working on satellite
communication systems, and has recently worked extensively with
service oriented architecture and event sourcing in Ruby. Nathan is a
contributor to the Eventide toolkit for event-sourced autonomous
services in Ruby.</p>

      <h2 class="conference-emphasis">Talk Session</h2>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>The Aggregate, The Cohesion, and The Cargo Cult: Rise and Fall of Critical Thinking in DDD</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy"><strong>Co-presented with <a href="scott-bellware.html">Scott Bellware</a></strong></p>

      <p class="copy">Since its introduction in 2003, Domain-Driven Design patterns have had a history of cargo-cult implementations, from DDD Light to implementing an entire bounded context as a single class. This presentation isn’t a definitive history of all of the questionable things that have been done in the name of DDD, but it points out particular characteristics and causes of cargo cult thinking in geek culture, and recasts “geek” as a chief cause of long-lived software mistakes, rather than an identity to be venerated.</p>
