      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Nathan Ladd has been writing software professionally for over 10
years, specializing in domain driven design, architecture, and systems
engineering. He works primarily in Ruby, C, and Javascript. He started
his career as an embedded systems engineer working on satellite
communication systems, and has recently worked extensively with
service oriented architecture and event sourcing in Ruby. Nathan is a
contributor to the Eventide toolkit for event-sourced autonomous
services in Ruby.</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>The Aggregate, The Cohesion, and The Cargo Cult: Rise and Fall of Critical Thinking in DDD</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy"><strong>Co-presented with <a href="scott-bellware.html">Scott Bellware</a></strong></p>

      <p class="copy">For the last 2 years now, we have been working on gradually modernizing a large and complex business critical application in Statoil. This 20 year old giant was mainly written in a 4GL (CA Gen), and we wanted to utilize the power of DDD and BDD when rewriting it piece by piece. Now, 2 years later, we find it very facinating to look back at where we came from and where we are now. Of course, much of our code base is in a very different shape, so much easier to understand, work with and change. But also, the entire team culture has transformed. We now have a completely new way of looking at how software is designed and built, how we work together and so on. Our team consisted of about 10 people, with great variation in knowledge, preferences and personality. Doing this transformation with them, has been a great experience; lots of blood, sweat and tears, lots of fun. In this presentation weâ€™d like to share with you the story including what we learned and the key takeaways, both the happy parts and the tougher parts, both the technical aspects and the learnings around how to achieve a well functional DDD team.</p>
