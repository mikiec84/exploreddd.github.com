        <p class="copy">Jessica Kerr is a developer at Atomist, where she works on development automation. She believes software is more important than the programs we produce, because software can teach us about complexity, and therefore life. Jessica speaks at conferences on three continents, podcasts on >Code and Arrested DevOps, and tweets as @jessitron.</p>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Talk Session</h2>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Why Domain-Driven Design Matters</h2>
        <p class="copy">Since last year at Explore DDD, Jessica has asked the question: why does DDD get so many things right? There are many ways that DDD anticipated trends like microservices and functional programming, and yet the DDD community seems not to suffer from gratuitous overuse of them.</p>
        <p class="copy">In her studies of resilience engineering, DevOps, and symmathesy, Jessica looks for the truths inside DDD that make it so fruitful. In this session she will tell you about growth loops, intentionality, un-simplicity, and why domain driven design is more than a methodology or strategy. It holds insights for a way of thinking and of living.</p>
