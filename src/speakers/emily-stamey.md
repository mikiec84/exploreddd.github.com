        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Hey Boss, Event Sourcing Could Fix That!</h2>
        <p class="copy">Our application has so much going on! Slow page loads and a large legacy codebase make developers feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. In this session, we will cover the basics of Event Sourcing and ways that Event Sourcing has helped real projects.</p>
        <p class="copy">We'll explore a strategy to add a modern codebase alongside the legacy code, allowing them to run simultaneously until you replace the legacy code. We will also discuss common legacy problems like complex database queries causing slow downs and large reports that take so long to load, users must wait instead of analyzing the data. As our system has grown, we may need to separate our application into distinct parts and pass relevant information between them. Or maybe we have two distinct codebases which are affected by each other's changes in unexpected ways. We will examine how to add Event Sourcing and CQRS to these pain points and throw away that legacy spaghetti!</p>
