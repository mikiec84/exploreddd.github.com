      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">David Laribee is a coach, trainer, speaker, and co-founder of Nerd/Noir. He believes in the power of collaboration, simplicity, and feedback.

      <p class="copy">Over the last 20 years, David has built teams and products for companies of all shapes and sizes. He’s founded startups and consulted for Fortune 50 enterprises. He’s developed digital products in a wide variety of domains: banking, retail, technology, insurance, beverage distribution, and higher education (to name a few). David is a two-time Microsoft MVP in C# and Solutions Architecture and co-founder of the ALT.NET movement, which spawned dozens of user groups across the globe dedicated to open source and modern engineering practices.</p>

      <p class="copy">Before founding Nerd/Noir, David coached the product development team at VersionOne, a market leader in agile project management tools.</p>

      <p class="copy">David started work life at the early age of five on a farm in Upstate NY — an upbringing that accounts for his lead-from-the-front approach, appreciation for small/cross-disciplinary teams and disdain for fake maple syrup.</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Legendary Adventures in Legacy Code</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">We begin with a story: a story about a legendary monster (15,000+ line class) I recently engaged in mortal combat. No spoilers. It wasn't pretty, but here I stand to tell the tale, at the ready to enter the fray once again.</p>

      <p class="copy">Throughout our campaign we’ll take a few side quests and journeys into the three realms of technical debt: </p>

      <ol class="copy-list">
        <li>The alignments - Or, what does it take to engage in battle with demonic code?</li>
        <li>The armory - Or, what weapons are available to you and when do you brandish them?</li>
        <li>The lore and landscape - Or, where did these damned dragons come from in the first place?</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="copy">While this talk employs a nerdy, fantastical, and fun system metaphor to explore this world, all the essential facts are true. In addition to images of Cthulhu, Chromatic Dragons and Vampyres, expect a lot of code examples, technical deep dives, and practical lessons learned.</p>
