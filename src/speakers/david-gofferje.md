      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Many internal talks in customer contexts about lots of different subjects (object orientation, DDD, Java, design) over the last 15 years.</p>
      <p class="copy">Instructed about 60 students in a 2-day DDD-introduction in 2015 / 2016.</p>
      <p class="copy">Really looking forward to broaden the horizon and speak in front of a enthusiastic larger audience!</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Domainify Your Code: Next-level Ubiquitous language</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Domain-driven design tells us to name the aggregates, entities and value objects according to the concepts within the domain we are modeling. Also, the behavior expressed by method names of their interfaces and classes should adhere to and comprise the ubiquitous language. This is usually as far as we go, polluting (the direct surroundings of) our domain with a lot of technical and non-domain related naming: Implemented patterns are reflected within class names, so are events and their handlers, as well as exceptions.</p>

      <p class="copy">Why not take domainifying even further, and really adopt the ubiquitous language by expelling technical and non-domain filth? I'll show how to not lose technical intent in the process while doing so. This way, we're creating a more much natural and domain-like language, that is also easier for the business to understand and is directly reflected in the code that implements it in the system. Shared, well-defined concepts throughout both design and code prevent misinterpretation, promote traceability and enable pair programming together with the domain experts!</p>

      <p class="copy">In this talk, I'll introduce a series of guidelines, illustrate the value they provide and show their application by small, yet meaningful changes, that will help you make your code more expressive, closer to its domain's design and easier to reason about with your domain expert. Using a lot of examples, weâ€™ll make baby-step refactorings into a breakthrough and turn our Java code into a Domain-Specific Language (DSL)!</p>
