        <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><a href="../workshops/practical-ddd.html">Practical DDD: Make Your Software Systems Reliable Using NServiceBus</a></h2>
        <p class="copy">Designing and developing complex software systems takes discipline. Domain-Driven Design guides you with a certain set of fundamental disciplines to navigate the complexities. Combining those disciplines with a technology like messaging helps you to identify the bottlenecks of your systems. For example, places where your system is temporally coupled. <a href="../workshops/practical-ddd.html">Read more...</a></p>

        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Practical DDD: Bounded Contexts + Events => Microservices</h2>
        <p class="copy">Domain Driven Design and Messaging go hand in hand, like a warm chocolate brownie paired with vanilla ice-cream! DDD is a software discipline that allows you to move faster and write high-quality code. The whole point is to align the software you write to be flexible with the business changes. When you start to use the technology of messaging to communicate between clean and well-defined bounded contexts you get to remove temporal coupling. And voila, you now have microservices that are built for autonomy from the ground up. Sounds perfect?</p>
        <p class="copy">In this talk, discover this intersection of DDD as a software discipline with messaging as a technology counterpart. Build reliable systems that can scale with the business changes.</p>
