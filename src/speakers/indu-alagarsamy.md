      <h2>1-Day pre-conference workshop, Wed, Sept 18</h2>
      <h2><a href="../workshops/design-reliable-systems-using-ddd-and-messaging.html">DESIGN RELIABLE SYSTEMS USING DDD & MESSAGING</a></h2>
      <p>Using message queues is the first step in building more reliable systems. However, this takes a different approach to reasoning about the design of your system, and the structure of your code. But reliability is as much a domain modeling concern as a technical quality. How can we deal with complex business processes, that can fail at multiple points in time? How do we roll back multiple operations in a long-running business process? <a href="../workshops/design-reliable-systems-using-ddd-and-messaging.html">Read more...</a></p>
      <h2>Talk Session</h2>
      <h2 class="gold">Practical DDD: Bounded Contexts + Events => Microservices</h2>
      <p>Domain Driven Design and Messaging go hand in hand, like a warm chocolate brownie paired with vanilla ice-cream! DDD is a software discipline that allows you to move faster and write high-quality code. The whole point is to align the software you write to be flexible with the business changes. When you start to use the technology of messaging to communicate between clean and well-defined bounded contexts you get to remove temporal coupling. And voila, you now have microservices that are built for autonomy from the ground up. Sounds perfect?</p>
      <p>In this talk, discover this intersection of DDD as a software discipline with messaging as a technology counterpart. Build reliable systems that can scale with the business changes.</p>
