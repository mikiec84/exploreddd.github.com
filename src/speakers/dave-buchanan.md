        <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Talk Session</h2>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Domain modeling with your Product Team</h2>
        <p>There's a lot of cross over between Product Design and Domain Modeling. However there are critical pieces missing when Product controls the "design" of a new feature.</p> 
        <p>This talk will walk through how, in the past year, the InboxDollars Dev and Product teams have worked to bridge the main gaps. Such as agreeing on core domain concepts, adjusting "design week" sprints to incorporate DDD, and replacing user stories with event storming.</p>
        <p>The main theme is to show how we are building the product, with software design being a main consideration.</p>
