      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">I’m a software developer, I love to code. It’s my hobby, my job, my passion. I'm a passionate entrepreneur: founder member of Why Not Soluciones, S.L. and associate at Visualbox.</p>

      <p class="copy">I'm seeking professional growth with each project giving always the most of me. I also require that from employees, peers and partners.</p>

      <p class="copy">I also love to teach, especially business tools such as the Business Model Canvas and the Value Proposition Design and their applications in the software development field.</p>

      <p class="copy">I recently kickstarted a Domain-Driven Design meetup in Madrid where I give talks and I also started giving talks at proper conferences such as DDD eXchange in London.</p>

      <h2 class="conference-emphasis">Talk Session</h2>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Black Ops DDD using the Business Model Canvas</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">If you are trying to adopt Domain-Driven Design within your organisation you will need to drag the business people into it and yes, you should expect resistance. You will have to use unconventional techniques to make this happen... In this talk you will learn how Javier gained buy-in from both business and IT in a corporate organisation after they took part in a sneaky experiment involving the Business Model Canvas.

      <p class="copy">The adoption of Domain-Driven Design will require a mindset revamp across your whole company. However, convincing people they should commit to change is probably the greatest challenge an organisation can face.</p>

      <p class="copy">Making changes is not easy and you will need to leverage this in order to succeed. You'll be required to think out of the box and look out there for new tools. Only then you will be able to truly involve the rest of the organisation, especially your business fellows.

      <p class="copy">Fortunately you can make use of the Business Model Canvas: a popular tool designed to generate business models. This tool will help business to perceive Domain-Driven Design practices in a less shocking way. By making your counterparts feel more comfortable you will build a good atmosphere and your peers will be open for changes.</p>

      <p class="copy">Get to know what the Business Model Canvas is and how you can tweak it to help you gain buy-in from your organisation to adopt Domain-Driven Design. In addition you will get some real world tips Javier learned while putting this handy tool into practice.</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Domain Discovery using the Business Model Canvas</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Related to the proposed talk, I'd like to prepare a workshop to show off how this tool can be used in order to discover domains.</p>

      <p class="copy">The dynamics would be in two steps: first fill in a business model canvas to identify a value proposition. In this step attendees will get to know the tool itself and how to use it.</p>

      <p class="copy">The second step would be to use a blank business model canvas to 'migrate' the learnings of the business into a proper domain discovery.Related to the proposed talk, I'd like to prepare a workshop to show off how this tool can be used in order to discover domains.</p>
