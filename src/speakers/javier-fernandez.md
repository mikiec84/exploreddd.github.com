      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">I’m a software developer, I love to code. It’s my hobby, my job, my passion. I'm a passionate entrepreneur: founder member of Why Not Soluciones, S.L. and associate at Visualbox.</p>

      <p class="copy">I'm seeking professional growth with each project giving always the most of me. I also require that from employees, peers and partners.</p>

      <p class="copy">I also love to teach, especially business tools such as the Business Model Canvas and the Value Proposition Design and their applications in the software development field.</p>

      <p class="copy">I recently kickstarted a Domain-Driven Design meetup in Madrid where I give talks and I also started giving talks at proper conferences such as DDD eXchange in London, Explore DDD in Denver and KanDDDinsky in Berlin.</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Black Ops DDD using the Business Model Canvas</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">In my talk "Black Ops DDD using the Business Model Canvas" you will find out what this is and how can it be used to achieve some DDD goals. If you want to know more about this wonderful tool, don't miss this workshop where you will take away:</p>

      <ul class="copy-list">
        <li>Have a deeper understanding of what the Business Model Canvas is and how to use it to generate business models</li>.
        <li>Experiment with the generated business models and test hypothesis.</li>
        <li>Apply the learnings of the business model into Domain Discovery using the Business Model Canvas.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="conference-emphasis">Hands On Session</h2>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Domain Discovery using the Business Model Canvas</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Related to the proposed talk, I'd like to prepare a workshop to show off how this tool can be used in order to discover domains.</p>

      <p class="copy">The dynamics would be in two steps: first fill in a business model canvas to identify a value proposition. In this step attendees will get to know the tool itself and how to use it.</p>

      <p class="copy">The second step would be to use a blank business model canvas to 'migrate' the learnings of the business into a proper domain discovery.Related to the proposed talk, I'd like to prepare a workshop to show off how this tool can be used in order to discover domains.</p>
