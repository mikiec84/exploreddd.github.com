        <h2>1-Day pre-conference workshop, Wed, Sept 18</h2>
        <h2><a href="../workshops/code-as-a-crime-scene.html">Code as a Crime Scene: Fix Technical Debt with Behavioral Code Analysis</a></h2>
        <p>In this workshop you learn novel analysis techniques that support both technical and organizational decisions around your codebase. The techniques use data from the most underused informational source that we have in our industry: our version-control system. Combined with metaphors from forensic psychology you learn to analyze version-control data. <a href="../workshops/code-as-a-crime-scene.html">Read more...</a></p>
        <h2>Talk Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Prioritizing technical debt as if time and money matters</h2>
        <p>Many codebases contain code that is overly complicated, hard to understand, and hence expensive to change and evolve. Prioritizing the technical debt to pay off is a hard problem as modern systems might have millions of lines of code and multiple development teams -- no-one has a holistic overview. In addition, there's always a trade-off between improving existing code versus adding new features so we need to use our time wisely. So what if we could mine the collective intelligence of all contributing programmers, and start to make decisions based on information from how the organization actually works with the code?</p>
        <p>In this presentation you'll see how easily obtained version-control data let us uncover the behavior and patterns of the development organization. This language-neutral approach lets you prioritize the parts of your system that benefit the most from improvements, so that you can balance short- and long-term goals guided by data. The specific examples are from real-world codebases like Android, the Linux Kernel, .Net Core Runtime, and more. This new perspective on software development will change how you view code.</p>
