        <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>
        <p class="copy">With over 30 years of experience as a professional software developer, I have worked with a number of complex domains, which include: technical document management, computer aided design, and ad-hoc workflow systems.</p>
        <p class="copy">In 2007, I attended a half day seminar on DDD conducted by Eric Evans. The seminar, and the blue book that came with it, scratched an itch I had barely been aware of.</p>
        <p class="copy">For the last ten years, my focus has been building tools to model massive re/insurance structures.</p>

        <p class="copy">Understanding and managing catastrophe risk is of vital importance to the re/insurance industry. Risk Management Solutions is a leader in providing physical CAT models for perils such as Earthquake, Flood and Hurricane. Our financial model was hard to understand, and harder to enhance.</p>
        <p class="copy">Informed by such concepts as ubiquitous language, bounded context, and model-driven design, we developed a simple language to represent and execute the terms and conditions of re/insurance contracts. An even simpler language was developed for the flows of money through arbitrarily complex structures of such contracts. That took us three years. The other seven it took to bring these to market - well, come and hear the story.</p>
