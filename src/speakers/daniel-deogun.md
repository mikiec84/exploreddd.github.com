      <p class="copy">Daniel Deogun is a Coder and Quality Defender who fights security issues on a daily basis using magic spells from DDD and an overall security mindset. In his spare time, Daniel coauthors the book Secure by Design together with Dan Bergh Johnsson and Daniel Sawano. As a developer, Daniel started to play with Java in 1997 and his extensive experience ranges from patient critical pacemaker systems to web applications to high performant software in the gaming industry. Combining this with his passion for tech have made him a frequent speaker at international conferences such as DDD Europe, DDD eXchange, and JavaZone. Daniel is currently a senior consultant at Omegapoint in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Domain Primitives in Action - Making it Secure by Design</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">What are the basic blocks of which you build a domain? It is probably not integers, strings, and floats. Instead it might be things such as “room number,” “track,” or “time slot.” They might be simple, they might be complex, but they are the simplest things that still makes sense in your domain - these are your domain primitives.</p>

      <p class="copy">Obviously, value objects are a feasible way of implementing many domain primitives. But certainly not all value objects are primitives. In this session, we’ll dive into what domain primitives are and how they enable solutions that make your code secure by design. In addition, we’ll show how domain primitives in combination with context mapping gives a powerful way to clean up legacy code. We cover some concrete patterns that you can start using immediately.</p>

      <p class="copy">This presentation is partly based on material from upcoming book Secure by Design by Dan Bergh Johnsson, Daniel Deogun, and Daniel Sawano.</p>
