        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Modelling the Domain Model with the User's Mental Model in Mind</h2>
        <p>Having a usability background, I see a lot of similarities between UX methods focusing on the userÂ´s mental model and Domain Driven Design.</p> 
        <p>In this talk I will share my experiences from a 3 year project where we successfully used DDD to break up a big giant monolith application into a modularized solution. I will use real examples to illustrate both the easy and the hard part of modeling our domain model.</p>
        <p>I will also share my reflections of whether our modeling challenges can partly be explained by focusing on the user's mental model, and how this can shed light on why defining the domain model sometimes is a struggle.</p>
