      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Anita is a UX passionate software developer. She has more than 20 years of experience with creating business critical applications, mainly for Statoil ASA, a huge Norwegian oil and gas company. Anita has experience from all parts of the software design process, lately focusing more and more on Domain Driven Design and Behaviour Driven Development. Anita enjoys spending her workdays with her team while using her knowledge of the users and their domain and applying this insight toward the utilization of Domain Driven Design principles in the solutions process.</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>From legacy chaos to the Promised Land of DDD</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">For the last 2 years we have been working on gradually modernizing a large and complex business critical application in Statoil. This 20 year old giant was mainly written in a 4GL (CA Gen), and we wanted to utilize the power of DDD and BDD when rewriting it piece by piece. Now, 2 years later, we find it very fascinating to look back at where we came from and where we are now. Of course, much of our code base is in a very different shape and is much easier to understand, work with and change. Additionally, the entire team culture has transformed. We now have a completely new way of looking at how software is designed and built as well as how we work together. Our team consisted of about 10 people with a great variation in knowledge, preferences and personality. Doing this transformation with them has been a great experience consisting of lots of blood, sweat and tears, but most importantly lots of fun. In this presentation weâ€™d like to share with you the story of what we learned and the key takeaways, both the happy parts and the tougher parts, both the technical aspects and the learnings around how to achieve a well functional DDD team.</p>
