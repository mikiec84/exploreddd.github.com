      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">Anita is a UX passionate software developer. She has more than 20 years of experience with creating business critical applications, mainly for Statoil ASA, a huge Norwegian oil and gas company. Anita has experience from all part of the software design process, lately focusing more and more on Domain Driven Design and Behaviour Driven Development. Knowing the users and their domain and using this insight to designing solutions by applying Domain Driven Design principles, together with the rest of the people in her team, is something Anita thinks make a day at work a good place to be.</p>

      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>From legacy chaos to the Promised Land of DDD</strong></h2>

      <p class="copy">For the last 2 years now, we have been working on gradually modernizing a large and complex business critical application in Statoil. This 20 year old giant was mainly written in a 4GL (CA Gen), and we wanted to utilize the power of DDD and BDD when rewriting it piece by piece. Now, 2 years later, we find it very facinating to look back at where we came from and where we are now. Of course, much of our code base is in a very different shape, so much easier to understand, work with and change. But also, the entire team culture has transformed. We now have a completely new way of looking at how software is designed and built, how we work together and so on. Our team consisted of about 10 people, with great variation in knowledge, preferences and personality. Doing this transformation with them, has been a great experience; lots of blood, sweat and tears, lots of fun. In this presentation weâ€™d like to share with you the story including what we learned and the key takeaways, both the happy parts and the tougher parts, both the technical aspects and the learnings around how to achieve a well functional DDD team.</p>
