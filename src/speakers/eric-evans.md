      <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>biography</strong></h2>
      <p class="copy">Eric Evans is the author of “Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in Software,” Addison-Wesley 2004.</p>
      <p class="copy">Since the early 1990s, he has worked on many projects developing large business systems with objects with many different approaches and many different outcomes. The book is a synthesis of that experience. It presents a system of modeling and design techniques that successful teams have used to align complex software systems with business needs and to keep projects agile as systems grow large.</p>
      <p class="copy">Eric now leads “Domain Language”, a consulting group which coaches and trains teams applying domain-driven design, helping them to make their development work more productive and more valuable to their business.</p>

This course delves into principles for clarifying the big picture, getting effort focused on the core, and coordinating multi-team development. <a href="../workshops/strategic-ddd.html">Read more...</a></p>
