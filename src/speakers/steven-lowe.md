He ran an innovative custom software development company for nearly a decade before joining ThoughtWorks as a Principal Consultant in 2014. He admits to being the author of "From Burnout to Bonfire" and a willing participant in the band Noise in the Basement, but neither confirms nor denies being the science-fiction author Steven Ayel. His latest book, Head-First Domain-Driven Design, will be published in 2018. </p>
