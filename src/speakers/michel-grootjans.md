        <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Playing With Projections</h2>
        <p class="copy">Co-presented with <a href="thomas-coopman.html">Thomas Coopman</a></p>
        <p class="copy">In this session, you will be working for an online Quiz Platform. Based on the full event history of the past years, you will have to answer to business questions, like: did our last ad campaign have any real impact, are we targeted by spammers, what kind of new campaigns should we launch? To solve these problems, you will need to transform the event stream to a structure, a projection, that can answer these questions.</p>
        <p class="copy">This is a hands-on session where you will be coding. You will be implementing projections based on an event stream we provide. Don’t forget to bring your laptop or be prepared to pair with someone else. Mob programming would be awesome. This is not an advanced workshop, so everyone can progress at their own pace, but you do have to be able to write code (if you can’t code, but you find a coder to pair with, that’s of course fine)!</p>
        <p class="copy">We provide clients in several languages so you can start answering the business questions very swiftly. If you’d want to try this in a technology stack that we haven’t provided, just make sure you are able to call a REST service with JSON.</p>
