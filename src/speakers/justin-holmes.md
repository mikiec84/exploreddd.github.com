        <h2 class="speaker-subheader gold">Visualizing Your Event Storm in New Ways</h2>
        <p class="copy">Event Storming can be a powerful way to discover your domain. But, the shared understanding built in the room can be difficult to share with remote stakeholders, offshore development teams, and operators (both business and technical) running the system in production. This talk will explore an approach to visualizing the processes defined by your event storm as they are executed across a distributed system. In particular, we’ll explore ways to ensure components of the distributed system stay autonomous and that the visualization component does not become a bottleneck in the delivery process or architecture. And to bring it all together, there will be a live demonstration.</p>
