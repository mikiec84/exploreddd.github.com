	<h2 class="page-subheader">What's different about the Explore DDD Conference?</h2>
	<p class="copy">World-class talks and workshops from DDD practitioners and industry experts? Of course! But Explore DDD takes the notion/idea of conference engagement and exploration to a whole new level. An entire area of the conference floor will be dedicated to domain model exploration with others, where drawing and refining domain models is both expected and encouraged. We'll provide everything you need to cover walls with stickies, whiteboards with drawings, and make new friends and problem-solve together.
</p>
	<p class="copy">Practice your domain modeling techniques and skills collaboratively, and learn new and innovative techniques from each other while engaging with DDD experts such as Eric Evans, Paul Rayner, Vaughn Vernon, Alberto Brandolini and others. No other conference in the USA offers this opportunity to observe domain modeling in action, and practice and learn together in this way.</p>
	<p class="copy">We've deliberately opted for a smaller, more intimate conference, with a hard limit of 330 attendees due to venue size. Speaking of venue, we've selected an incredible, inspiring location for the conference! The 38th floor Pinnacle Club of the Grand Hyatt Denver, with the entire conference floor provides uninterrupted majestic views of the Rocky Mountains, downtown Denver, and city surrounds.</p>

	<h2 class="page-subheader">Is this conference for me?</h2>
	<p class="copy">Are you a Senior Developer, team lead, or Software Architect with several years of experience building software systems for complex domains? Are you a DDD explorer, enthusiast, or expert? If so, then this conference is for you.</p>
	<p class="copy">Gain deep insights on your software system questions from your peers and industry experts. You could solve your nagging software problems during the conference with help from other attendees. What would that be worth to you and your company?</p>

	<h2 class="page-subheader">What is Domain-Driven Design?</h2>
	<p class="copy">Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to developing software for complex needs by deeply connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts.</p>
	<ul class="copy list">
		<li>Place the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic for the competitive advantage of the business</li>
		<li>Base complex designs on a model of the business domain</li>
		<li>Initiate a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively cut ever closer to the conceptual heart of the problem.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="copy">These guiding principles sound simple, but pulling them off in the messy, real world is hard. It calls for new skills and discipline, and a systematic approach.</p>
	<p class="copy">Domain-driven design is not a technology or a methodology. DDD provides a structure of practices and terminology for making design decisions that focus and accelerate software projects dealing with complicated domains. (Text adapted from domainlanguage.com)</p>

	<h2 class="page-subheader">What programming languages should I know?</h2>
	<p class="copy">The conference does not focus on any particular programming language or technology. Many sessions might have code in them, but you’ll be able to follow even if you don’t know that language that is used. If knowledge of a particular programming language is required for, say, participation in a workshop, this will be indicated in the conference program.</p>

	<h2 class="page-subheader">Will the talks be recorded?</h2>
	<p class="copy">Yes. We’ll be recording the talks and publishing them online after the conference. The workshops and unconference types of activities will not be recorded.</p>

	<h2 class="page-subheader">What does this conference cost?</h2>
	<p class="copy">Conference ticket prices are $995 for earlybird, and $1,295 for full price. The two-day workshops are $1,500 for both days. For accommodation, we highly recommend booking early at the Grand Hyatt Denver conference hotel, since hotel room availability at this time of year in Denver is extremely limited and we have reserved a block of rooms with a discounted conference room rate of $199/night.</p>

	<h2 class="page-subheader">What is included in the ticket prices?</h2>
	<p class="copy">The conference ticket gives you access to the main event conference sessions. You'll be able to attend all the talks. To attend the workshops, you need a separate ticket. All tickets include lunch and beverages. Not included in the ticket price are accommodation, travel, social events, dinners, or any other costs, unless specifically indicated.</p>

	<h2 class="page-subheader">Can I speak at the conference?</h2>
	<p class="copy">We are looking for interesting talk that will enlighten and empower our community. Please submit your talk to our CFP process and we'll get in contact with you.</p>

	<h2 class="page-subheader">How can I become a sponsor?</h2>
	<p class="copy">We are always looking for partners to help us bring the greatest possible event to our community. Contact us and we will be happy to discuss sponsorship opportunities with you.</p>

	<h2 class="page-subheader">What is the conference Code of Conduct?</h2>
	<p class="copy"><i>We aim to provide a safe learning experience for all conference participants, and thus expect them to be kind and respectful to others. We embrace diversity of human experience and the strength it brings to our communities and relationships.</i> </p>
	<p class="copy">We care deeply about making Explore DDD a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
