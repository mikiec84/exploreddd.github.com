In September 2017, join fellow software developers and architects in Denver to learn about DDD and how it can accelerate the delivery of software when dealing with complex business domains. This two-day conference (+ workshops) sets the perfect stage to discover how others are using DDD to build better software.

Fuel your passion for tackling complexity in the heart of software: the highest-quality talks and workshops, walls covered with stickies and models, and brainstorming together with smart people! The content is programming language agnostic and spans analysis, modeling and design, systems thinking and complexity theory, architecture, testing and refactoring, visualisation, collaboration, and more!

Is this conference for me?

Are you a Senior Developer, team lead, or Software Architect with several years of experience building software systems for complex domains? Are you a DDD explorer, enthusiast, or expert? If so, then this conference is for you.

What is Domain-Driven Design?

Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to developing software for complex needs by deeply connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts.

Place the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic for the competitive advantage of the business
Base complex designs on a model of the business domain
Initiate a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively cut ever closer to the conceptual heart of the problem.

These guiding principles sound simple, but pulling them off in the messy, real world is hard. It calls for new skills and discipline, and a systematic approach.

Domain-driven design is not a technology or a methodology. DDD provides a structure of practices and terminology for making design decisions that focus and accelerate software projects dealing with complicated domains. (Text adapted from domainlanguage.com)

What programming languages should I know?

The conference does not focus on any particular programming language or technology. Many sessions might have code in them, but you’ll be able to follow even if you don’t know that language that is used. If knowledge of a particular programming language is required for, say, participation in a workshop, this will be indicated in the conference program.

Will the talks be recorded?

Yes. We’ll be recording the talks and publishing them online after the conference. The workshops and unconference types of activities will not be recorded.

What is included in the ticket prices?

The conference ticket gives you access to the main event conference sessions. You'll be able to attend all the talks. To attend the workshops, you need a separate ticket. All tickets include lunch and beverages. Not included in the ticket price are accommodation, travel, social events, dinners, or any other costs, unless specifically indicated.

Can I speak at the conference?
We are looking for interesting talk that will enlighten and empower our community. Please submit your talk to our CFP process and we'll get in contact with you.

How can I become a sponsor?

We are always looking for partners to help us bring the greatest possible event to our community. Contact us and we will be happy to discuss sponsorship opportunities with you.

What is the conference Code of Conduct?

We care deeply about making Explore DDD a safe and welcoming space for everyone. In light of this, all attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.
