            <p class="copy">Itâ€™s easy to get lost in the patterns and acronyms and miss the essence of DDD. This workshop will provide you with a solid grounding in the foundational ideas, techniques and skills for doing DDD well in your own project context. The workshop is very hands-on and interactive, will help you connect everything in DDD together and see how it fits and what's most important, and give you practical tools to take away and try on your project. <a class="read-more" href="../speakers/paul-rayner.html">Read more...</a></p>
