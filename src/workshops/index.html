        <h2 class="speaker-subheader">biography</h2>
        <p class="copy">Eric Evans is the author of “Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in Software,” Addison-Wesley 2004.</p>

        <p class="copy">Since the early 1990s, he has worked on many projects developing large business systems with objects with many different approaches and many different outcomes. The book is a synthesis of that experience. It presents a system of modeling and design techniques that successful teams have used to align complex software systems with business needs and to keep projects agile as systems grow large.</p>

        <p class="copy">Eric now leads “Domain Language”, a consulting group which coaches and trains teams applying domain-driven design, helping them to make their development work more productive and more valuable to their business.</p>

            <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Two day pre-conference workshop, Sept. 19-20 2017</h2>

            <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Strategic DDD</strong></h2>

            <p class="copy">Some design decisions have an impact on the trajectory of the whole project. Modeling is most needed in complex circumstances, yet the typical dynamics of large projects too often derail it or disconnect it from the real design. This course delves into principles for clarifying the big picture, getting effort focused on the core, and coordinating multi-team development.</p>

            <p class="copy">The target audience is IT Leaders, Development Managers, Enterprise Architects, Software Architects, Senior Developers and Development Leads. We recommend attendees have experience with large systems multi-team development. In this class you will learn how to:</p>

            <ul class="copy-list">
            <li>Get a big-picture of multi-team development as it pertains to design success.</li>
            <li>Make most effective use of off-the-shelf components in a mixture with in-house development.</li>
            <li>Manage diverse styles of design, development process and quality within a large system, and still maintain the ability to innovate around your core domain</li>
            <li>Develop multiple strategies for setting up a fresh project that can break with the past, even when the organization is tied to legacy systems.</li>
