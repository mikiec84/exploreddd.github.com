        <p class="copy" style="margin-top: 25px">EventStorming is a workshop format that promotes collaboration between different disciplines in order to sove business problems in the most effective way.</p>
        <p class="copy">In this two day format we’ll experience the different formats, working around real business problems.
        We’ll take into account the different perspectives (including the facilitator) in a process that spans large scale discovery, to leverage collaborative design.
        We’ll experience the how, and we’ll discuss the why.</p>
