            <p class="copy">You’ll also learn the nitty-gritty details of building production-ready systems including:</p>
            <ul class="copy-list">
                <li>Fault tolerance – HTTP and queues</li>
                <li>Reliable integration with 3rd party systems</li>
                <li>Scalability, high availability & monitoring</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="copy">Finally, get some hands-on experience in SOA development by building:</p>
            <ul class="copy-list">
                <li>Scalable command-processing endpoints</li>
                <li>Publish/subscribe event-processing interactions</li>
                <li>Long-running multi-stage business processes and policies</li>

            <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Objectives</h2>
            <p class="copy">We’ll understand service oriented architecture concepts, and DDD concepts such as bounded contexts and data ownership.</p>
            <p class="copy">We’ll apply those concepts to build a simple, yet fully functional, order management system sample with a service-oriented architecture, using patterns such as command processing, pub/sub, and long-running sagas.</p>
            <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Table of Contents</h2>
            <ul class="copy-list">
                <li>Introduction to boundaries and data ownership</li>
                <li>Microservices and vertical slices</li>
                <li>Building a UI on top of bounded contexts</li>
                <li>Introduction to pub/sub as a communication pattern</li>
                <li>Reliable messaging concepts</li>
                <li>How to reduce coupling across microservices</li>
                <li>Introduction to commands as a communication pattern</li>
