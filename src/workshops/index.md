			<p class="copy">In this class you will learn a modern approach for building scalable, highly available and easily maintainable applications. We will describe the microservices architecture and show how it enables the agile development and deployment of applications. You will learn about the benefits and drawbacks of the microservice architecture and when they make sense. We will describe key topics including decomposition, service discovery, monitoring, testing, and deployment. By the end of the class you will have built a couple of microservices and deployed them using Docker.<a class="read-more" href="../speakers/chris-richardson.html">Read more...</a></p>

			<p  class="copy">It’s easy to get lost in the patterns and acronyms and miss the essence of DDD. This workshop will provide you with a solid grounding in the foundational ideas, techniques and skills for doing DDD well in your own project context. The workshop is very hands-on and interactive, will help you connect everything in DDD together and see how it fits and what's most important, and give you practical tools to take away and try on your project. <a class="read-more" href="../speakers/paul-rayner.html">Read more...</a></p>

			<p  class="copy">Some design decisions have an impact on the trajectory of the whole project. Modeling is most needed in complex circumstances, yet the typical dynamics of large projects too often derail it or disconnect it from the real design. This course delves into principles for clarifying the big picture, getting effort focused on the core, and coordinating multi-team development.<a class="read-more" href="../speakers/eric-evans.html">Read more...</a></p>

      We’ll take into account the different perspectives (including the facilitator) in a process that spans large scale discovery, to leverage collaborative design.
      We’ll experience the how, and we’ll discuss the why.<a class="read-more" href="../speakers/alberto-brandolini.html">Read more...</a></p>
