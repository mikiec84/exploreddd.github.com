        <p class="copy">EventStorming is a workshop format that promotes collaboration between different disciplines in order to sove business problems in the most effective way. In this two day format we’ll experience the different formats, working around real business problems. We’ll take into account the different perspectives (including the facilitator) in a process that spans large scale discovery, to leverage collaborative design. We’ll experience the how, and we’ll discuss the why. <a href="eventstorming-masterclass.html">Read more...</a></p>

        <p class="copy">Software design can have a very slow feedback loop: by the time you find out if the architectural and design decisions you made were the right ones, it may be too late for drastic changes. As developers, we tend to phrase all problems as technical problems, which can be sufficiently challenging in their own right. We tend to lose sight of the underlying business concerns. <a href="ddd-for-messaging-architectures.html">Read more...</a></p>

            <p class="copy">Some design decisions have an impact on the trajectory of the whole project. Modeling is most needed in complex circumstances, yet the typical dynamics of large projects too often derail it or disconnect it from the real design. This course delves into principles for clarifying the big picture, getting effort focused on the core, and coordinating multi-team development. <a href="strategic-ddd.html">Read more...</a></p>
