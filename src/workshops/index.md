        <p class="copy">Software design can have a very slow feedback loop: by the time you find out if the architectural and design decisions you made were the right ones, it may be too late for drastic changes. As developers, we tend to phrase all problems as technical problems, which can be sufficiently challenging in their own right. We tend to lose sight of the underlying business concerns. <a href="ddd-for-messaging-architectures.html">Read more...</a></p>

            <p class="copy">Some design decisions have an impact on the trajectory of the whole project. Modeling is most needed in complex circumstances, yet the typical dynamics of large projects too often derail it or disconnect it from the real design. This course delves into principles for clarifying the big picture, getting effort focused on the core, and coordinating multi-team development. <a href="strategic-ddd.html">Read more...</a></p>

            <p class="copy">It’s easy to get lost in the patterns and acronyms and miss the essence of DDD. This workshop will provide you with a solid grounding in the foundational ideas, techniques and skills for doing DDD well in your own project context. The workshop is very hands-on and interactive, will help you connect everything in DDD together and see how it fits and what's most important, and give you practical tools to take away and try on your project. <a href="essential-ddd.html">Read more...</a></p>

In this two day format we’ll experience the different formats, working around real business problems. We’ll take into account the different perspectives (including the facilitator) in a process that spans large scale discovery, to leverage collaborative design. We’ll experience the how, and we’ll discuss the why. <a href="eventstorming-masterclass.html">Read more...</a></p>

        <p class="copy">The architectural patterns of Domain Driven Design, Command Query Segregation Responsibility and Event Sourcing have proven to be important ingredients for building high performing, scalable applications. Audit requirements and the use of data analytics are also important reasons for choosing these patterns. Axon Framework builds on top of these concepts, helping developers build applications that evolve along with the domain. <a href="event-driven-microservices-with-axon-framework.html">Read more...</a></p>

        <p class="copy">Entity Framework half-heartedly supported DDD patterns. But the new-from-scratch EF Core has brought new hope for DDD practitioners to be able to map their DDD designed domain classes to a database without making so many concessions that a separate data model was needed. EF Core 2 is very DDD friendly even supporting things like fully encapsulated collections, backing fields and the return of support for value objects. In this hands on workshop you’ll work with well-designed aggregates and explore how far EF Core 2 goes to act as the data model between your domain classes and your data store. <a href="exploring-ef-core-support-for-ddd-patterns.html">Read more...</a></p>
