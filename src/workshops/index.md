        <p class="copy">EventStorming is a workshop format that promotes collaboration between different disciplines in order to sove business problems in the most effective way. In this two day format we’ll experience the different formats, working around real business problems. We’ll take into account the different perspectives (including the facilitator) in a process that spans large scale discovery, to leverage collaborative design. We’ll experience the how, and we’ll discuss the why. <a href="eventstorming-masterclass.html">Read more...</a></p>

        <p class="copy">Software design can have a very slow feedback loop: by the time you find out if the architectural and design decisions you made were the right ones, it may be too late for drastic changes. As developers, we tend to phrase all problems as technical problems, which can be sufficiently challenging in their own right. We tend to lose sight of the underlying business concerns. <a href="ddd-for-messaging-architectures.html">Read more...</a></p>

            <p class="copy">Some design decisions have an impact on the trajectory of the whole project. Modeling is most needed in complex circumstances, yet the typical dynamics of large projects too often derail it or disconnect it from the real design. This course delves into principles for clarifying the big picture, getting effort focused on the core, and coordinating multi-team development. <a href="strategic-ddd.html">Read more...</a></p>

            <p class="copy">New architectural paradigms like microservices and evolutionary architecture, as well as the challenges associated with managing data and transactional contexts in distributed systems, have generated a renewed interest in disciplined software design and modular decomposition strategies. We know that the secret to obtaining the benefits of these architectures is getting the boundaries right, both at the team and the component/service level, and then keeping them right as the software continues to evolve! A key reason for getting the boundaries right is that it allows us to create a unified and ubiquitous language within the bounded contexts those boundaries enclose, allowing the business and engineers to have productive and coherent conversations. <a href="domain-driven-design-and-event-driven-microservices.html">Read more...</a></p>

            <p class="copy">Creating multiple models for the same problem is one of the more important lessons that Domain Driven Design teaches us. It is a lot cheaper to quickly iterate over them and throw away less useful prototypes before we even start coding. However, creating multiple models can be hard. When we begin gaining insight from our domain, we suffer a lot from cognitive biases that get in our way to gain new insights. We need these insights before we even start thinking about modelling. Tools like event storming and example mapping can help us to deliberate discover, and battle these biases. They help you quickly gain insight into the problem space. But the fallacy here is that we can get locked into the tool, and get stuck again? <a href="eventstorming-and-example-mapping-from-problem-space-to-solution-space.html">Read more...</a></p>

            <p class="copy">In this workshop you will learn that with little effort you can improve your workflow by building your own set of tools made specifically for *your* context. Scaling applications, refactoring models, testing the solution, debugging problems, proving what happened, or deploying to production; CQRS and event sourcing make it easier. But all these advantages come at a cost. <a href="diy-event-sourcing-tooling.html">Read more...</a></p>
