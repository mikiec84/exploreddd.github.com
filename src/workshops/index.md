        <p class="copy">Software design can have a very slow feedback loop: by the time you find out if the architectural and design decisions you made were the right ones, it may be too late for drastic changes. As developers, we tend to phrase all problems as technical problems, which can be sufficiently challenging in their own right. We tend to lose sight of the underlying business concerns. <a href="ddd-for-messaging-architectures.html">Read more...</a></p>

            <p class="copy">Some design decisions have an impact on the trajectory of the whole project. Modeling is most needed in complex circumstances, yet the typical dynamics of large projects too often derail it or disconnect it from the real design. This course delves into principles for clarifying the big picture, getting effort focused on the core, and coordinating multi-team development. <a href="strategic-ddd.html">Read more...</a></p>

            <p class="copy">It’s easy to get lost in the patterns and acronyms and miss the essence of DDD. This workshop will provide you with a solid grounding in the foundational ideas, techniques and skills for doing DDD well in your own project context. The workshop is very hands-on and interactive, will help you connect everything in DDD together and see how it fits and what's most important, and give you practical tools to take away and try on your project. <a href="essential-ddd.html">Read more...</a></p>

In this two day format we’ll experience the different formats, working around real business problems. We’ll take into account the different perspectives (including the facilitator) in a process that spans large scale discovery, to leverage collaborative design. We’ll experience the how, and we’ll discuss the why. <a href="eventstorming-masterclass.html">Read more...</a></p>

        <p class="copy">The architectural patterns of Domain Driven Design, Command Query Segregation Responsibility and Event Sourcing have proven to be important ingredients for building high performing, scalable applications. Audit requirements and the use of data analytics are also important reasons for choosing these patterns. Axon Framework builds on top of these concepts, helping developers build applications that evolve along with the domain. <a href="event-driven-microservices-with-axon-framework.html">Read more...</a></p>

        <p class="copy">Test Driven Development and Refactoring are powerful tools. With them you can add new code to systems and make existing code more maintainable. However, refactoring code without having tests in place can be hazardous. This class presents a collection of dependency breaking and test writing techniques that can be used to get existing code safely under test for refactoring. These techniques can be used in conjunction with Test Driven Development to breathe new life into large existing code bases. This class is structured as a set of lectures, discussions, and hands on exercises.  <a href="working-effectively-with-legacy-code.html">Read more...</a></p>
