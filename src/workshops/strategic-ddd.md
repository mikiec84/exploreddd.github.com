            <p class="copy">Some design decisions have an impact on the trajectory of the whole project. Modeling is most needed in complex circumstances, yet the typical dynamics of large projects too often derail it or disconnect it from the real design. This course delves into principles for clarifying the big picture, getting effort focused on the core, and coordinating multi-team development.</p>
            <p class="copy">The target audience is IT Leaders, Development Managers, Enterprise Architects, Software Architects, Senior Developers and Development Leads. We recommend attendees have experience with large systems multi-team development. In this class you will learn how to:</p>
            <ul class="copy-list">
            <li>Get a big-picture of multi-team development as it pertains to design success.</li>
            <li>Make most effective use of off-the-shelf components in a mixture with in-house development.</li>
            <li>Manage diverse styles of design, development process and quality within a large system, and still maintain the ability to innovate around your core domain</li>
            <li>Develop multiple strategies for setting up a fresh project that can break with the past, even when the organization is tied to legacy systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="conference-emphasis">Talk Session</h2>
            <h2 class="speaker-subheader"><strong>Exploring Time</strong></h2>
            <p class="copy">Most of our best examples of model exploration happen behind closed corporate doors. Generic subdomains, such as time, may provide a way to try out approaches to domain modeling more publicly.
            <p class="copy">Most popular software libraries for managing time are based on similar models, and JodaTime, a common Java library being incorporated into Java 9, is a good example. It has a fairly good model, and illustrates the tendency for the first good idea to be the last idea. Exploration stops as soon as a workable solution is found. While this is actually not such a bad idea in supporting domains, it short-circuits work on the critical core domain.But how do we escape from these good models that stop our thinking? Eric will walk through some rich semantics of an alternate model of time and an associated library to illustrate that there is always another model.</p>
            <p class="copy">The code is in Clojure, but you donâ€™t need to know Clojure to understand the talk.</p>
