            <p class="copy" style="margin-top: 25px">Learn how to model a complex system and break it down into cohesive bounded contexts through hands-on group activities. This session will teach you skills you can immediately begin applying in your organisation to improve the autonomy of your software services and the teams that build and run them.</p>

            <p class="copy">This session will involve modelling a complex domain with Event Storming and then applying strategic modelling heuristics to various scenarios involving a variety of challenging business, organisational, and technical goals and constraints.</p> 
            <p class="copy">Lots of curve balls will be thrown at you, and youâ€™ll learn how to apply strategic modelling heuristics and find the best bounded contexts whatever the business goals, organisational realities and technical constraints may be. Along the way you will also learn about theoretical concepts, drawing on ideas from DDD, Systems Thinking, Promise Theory, Theory of Constraints, and more.</p>

            <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <p class="copy">With a blend of hands-on team activities, whole-classroom exercises, and just enough theoretical discussion, you will learn:</p>
