            <p class="copy">Building PHP applications using Domain-driven design techniques results in code that is easier to modify, maintain, and test, and a better user experience. In this tutorial, we will start by establishing a ubiquitous language. Then, we will learn the benefits of encapsulating business logic in PHP value objects using test-driven development.</p>
            <p class="copy">Next, we will learn how to setup bounded contexts, entities, and aggregate roots to manage state and protect invariants in both Symfony/Doctrine and Laravel/Eloquent environments. We will also cover more advanced topics in the DDD world, such as event sourcing and command query responsibility segregation.</p>
            <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Prerequisites:</h2>
            <p class="copy">PHP. Providing Docker images and example repository. Minimal front-end work so no specific PHP framework knowledge is required. Workshop will cover topics in both Symfony/Doctrine and Laravel/Eloquent.</p>
