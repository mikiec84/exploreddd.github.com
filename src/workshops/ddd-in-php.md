            <h2 class="speaker-subheader">You Will Learn To:</h2>
            <ul class="copy-list">
                <li>Discover a ubiquitous language and identify changes in the design of PHP classes, methods, and problem solving</li>
                <li>Assemble an incorruptible domain model in PHP by encapsulating business logic in
                immutable value objects, specifications, and entities</li>
                <li>Employ best practices for persisting and accessing entities and aggregate roots in
                Doctrine and Eloquent</li>
                <li>Construct DDD patterns and compare how Symfony, Laravel, and Zend Framework
                influence the design of DDD components</li>
                <li>Use advanced PHP object-oriented techniques to simplify code and reduce state
                complexity</li>
                <li>Organize and build your DDD project so you are working with frameworks and not
                against them</li>
                <li>Plan for change by using the Hexagonal Architecture Pattern</li>
                <li>Separate models into bounded contexts using namespaces and message passing
                between contexts</li>
                <li>Apply domain event publishing and subscribing synchronously and asynchronously</li>
                <li>Write your own DIY event sourcing and use libraries like EventSauce and Prooph</li>
                <li>Evaluate CQRS techniques using a command bus, read models, and thin controllers</li>
                <li>Devise a comprehensive test plan for a DDD PHP application</li>
                <li>Compare techniques for eliminating repetitive tasks in DDD PHP applications</li>
                <li>Introduce DDD to a “legacy” codebase</li>
                <li>Discover recommended resources for learning more about applying DDD in PHP</li>
            </ul>
