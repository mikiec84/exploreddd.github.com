            <p class="copy">The architectural patterns of Domain Driven Design, Command Query Segregation Responsibility and Event Sourcing have proven to be important ingredients for building high performing, scalable applications. Audit requirements and the use of data analytics are also important reasons for choosing these patterns. Axon Framework builds on top of these concepts, helping developers build applications that evolve along with the domain.</p>
            <p class="copy">This training is a very practical introduction to building evolutionary message-driven microservices systems using Axon Framework. The course starts with a general introduction into Axon Framework and its building blocks. On the second day, these components are scaled out, and we elaborate on dealing with several aspects that are important for distributed systems.</p>
            <h2 class="speaker-subheader">What the attendee will learn:</h2>
            <ul class="copy-list">

                <li>How to set up projects with Axon Framework for developing complex, future-proof applications.</li>
                <li>How Axon Framework helps to securely put the domain model into production</li>
                <li>How to evolve an application from structured monolith to a distributed system of microservices</li>
