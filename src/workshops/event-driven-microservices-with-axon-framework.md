            <p class="copy" style="margin-top: 25px">Strategic design does not stop at defining boundaries around business capabilities - it should reach out for truly smart endpoints, emphasize autonomy and the need for more coarse-grained and asynchronous APIs. The long-running services behind such APIs feel responsible for their business and sort out most problems without leaking internal troubles and bothering their clients. While long-running services will leverage domain events for decoupling, they will often expose their core functions as commands - in order to minimise overall coupling! Extracting the customer-facing core processes of companies into dedicated, long-running services allows to keep sight of larger-scale flows - without violating bounded contexts or introducing god services. In this talk, Martin not only explores strategic design in the light of understanding the long-running nature of delivering many real-life business capabilities. He will also show the practical side of the equation: implementing long-running behaviour of services, requiring proper reactions on failures, timeouts and the compensating actions sagas are known for. A new generation of lightweight, embeddable and scalable saga managers and flow engines assist in that endeavour. Expect real-life experience and many examples!</p>
            <p class="copy">During the first day, we’ll go from theoretical CQRS/ES knowledge to building practical applications with Axon Framework. We’ll start by setting up the infrastructure components and organizing the codebase practically. Then, through theory and practical exercises you will explore different topics.</p>
            <p class="copy">During the second day, continuing where the introduction stopped, you will learn more about the advanced features of the Axon Framework. It covers several strategies to scale out, as well as important aspects to deal with when operating applications in production.</p>

            <p class="copy">The workshop focuses on Axon Framework (Java based). It contains hands-on labs for which code will be provided.</p>
