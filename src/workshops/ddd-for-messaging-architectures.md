            <p class="copy" style="margin-top: 25px">Software design can have a very <strong>slow feedback loop:</strong> by the time you find out if the architectural and design decisions you made were the right ones, it may be too late for drastic changes. As developers, we tend to phrase all problems as technical problems, which can be sufficiently challenging in their own right. We tend to <strong>lose sight of the underlying business concerns.</strong></p>
            <p class="copy">Domain–Driven Design is <strong>total approach to building software for complex domains.</strong> It’s a way of thinking that helps you decide how to tackle complexity, and where to focus your efforts. By putting the business at the heart of our software, and keeping our domain model closely tied to our understanding of the business, we can create value at a much deeper level.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="copy">I spent three days immersed in the Domain–Driven Design world with Mathias. It was a great experience where I learned a lot about DDD. Mathias created an environment where we could interact all together experimenting with DDD. Furthermore Mathias adapted the workshop content dynamically to our needs and our concerns. It is a recommended experience!</p>

            <h2 class="speaker-subheader">This is what you learn:</h2>
            <p class="copy">In this workshop, we’ll explore this central premise of Domain–Driven Design. We’ll take a practical approach: participants will be working on real–world problems. There will be no easy answers. Instead, you’ll learn how to ask the right questions, and how to evaluate different models.

            <blockquote>
                <p class="copy">Event Storming is truly valuable, also as an exercise. I found the patterns to separate domains and their relations very interesting. (…) I’ve discovered that DDD has many patterns and strategies that we seem to have lost. It is essential knowledge for every developer, from junior to architect. For more experienced developers (and business architects), the Strategic Domain–Driven Design workshop gives theory and experience to better deal with (business) domains, relations, Bounded Contexts, and how to map systems. Must attend!” (translated from Dutch)</p>

            <h2 class="speaker-subheader">About the instructor</h2>
            <p class="copy">Mathias Verraes advises companies on building software for complex environments. This involves primarily analysis and modelling, but also code, architecture, testing, and refactoring “unmaintainable” systems. He has worked with clients in Finance, Automotive, Government, Logistics, E-Commerce, and more. He teaches Domain-Driven Design courses and co-organises the DDD Europe conference. When he’s not working, he’s at home in Kortrijk, Belgium, helping his two sons build crazy Lego train tracks.</p>
            <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Participation Requirements</h2>
            <ul class="copy-list">
                <li>You are a Software Developer with some years of experience in working with complex domains. You’re familiar with object–oriented programming.</li>
                <li>It’s recommended to read “Domain–Driven Design” (Evans, 2004), but not essential.</li>
                <li>Laptops or other devices are not required, but useful for taking notes.</li>
                <li>The course is programming language agnostic.</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                <p class="copy">Mathias made Domain–Driven Design very real and practical. He managed to find a good balance between practical workshop, theory, and sharing experiences. This workshop really gave me the keys to use DDD in our projects and showed me new perspectives like Event Sourcing. It is definitely a must have complement to the usual books by Eric Evans and Vaughn Vernon. I would definitely recommend this workshop to any developer or architect who is keen to learn a different way to model software.</p>
