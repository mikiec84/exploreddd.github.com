  <p>Design Driven Software</p>

  <div class="container section page about">
    <h1 class="section-header">About</h1>
    <p class="copy">In September 2017, join fellow software developers and architects in Denver to learn about DDD and how it can accelerate the delivery of software when dealing with complex business domains. This two-day conference (+ workshops) sets the perfect stage to discover how others are using DDD to build better software.</p>

    <p class="copy">Fuel your passion for tackling complexity in the heart of software: the highest-quality talks and workshops, walls covered with stickies and models, and brainstorming together with smart people! The content is programming language agnostic and spans analysis, modeling and design, systems thinking and complexity theory, architecture, testing and refactoring, visualisation, collaboration, and more!</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">Is this conference for me?</h2>

    <p class="copy">Are you a Senior Developer, team lead, or Software Architect with several years of experience building software systems for complex domains? Are you a DDD explorer, enthusiast, or expert? If so, then this conference is for you.</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">What is Domain-Driven Design?</h2>

    <p class="copy">Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to developing software for complex needs by deeply connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts.</p>

    <ul class="copy">
        <li>Place the project&#39;s primary focus on the core domain and domain logic for the competitive advantage of the business</li>
        <li>Base complex designs on a model of the business domain</li>
        <li>Initiate a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively cut ever closer to the conceptual heart of the problem.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="copy">These guiding principles sound simple, but pulling them off in the messy, real world is hard. It calls for new skills and discipline, and a systematic approach.</p>

    <p class="copy">Domain-driven design is not a technology or a methodology. DDD provides a structure of practices and terminology for making design decisions that focus and accelerate software projects dealing with complicated domains. (Text adapted from domainlanguage.com)</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">What programming languages should I know?</h2>

    <p class="copy">The conference does not focus on any particular programming language or technology. Many sessions might have code in them, but you’ll be able to follow even if you don’t know that language that is used. If knowledge of a particular programming language is required for, say, participation in a workshop, this will be indicated in the conference program.</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">Will the talks be recorded?</h2>

    <p class="copy">Yes. We’ll be recording the talks and publishing them online after the conference. The workshops and unconference types of activities will not be recorded.</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">What is included in the ticket prices?</h2>

    <p class="copy">The conference ticket gives you access to the main event conference sessions. You&#39;ll be able to attend all the talks. To attend the workshops, you need a separate ticket. All tickets include lunch and beverages. Not included in the ticket price are accommodation, travel, social events, dinners, or any other costs, unless specifically indicated.</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">Can I speak at the conference?</h2>
    <p class="copy">We are looking for interesting talk that will enlighten and empower our community. Please submit your talk to our CFP process and we&#39;ll get in contact with you.</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">How can I become a sponsor?</h2>

    <p class="copy">We are always looking for partners to help us bring the greatest possible event to our community. Contact us and we will be happy to discuss sponsorship opportunities with you.</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">What is the conference Code of Conduct?</h2>

    <p class="copy">We care deeply about making Explore DDD a safe and welcoming space for everyone. In light of this, all attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>

    <p class="copy">If you have any questions, or are harassed in any way, please contact Paul Rayner or approach someone of the staff. All reports are confidential.</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">The Quick Version</h2>

    <p class="copy">Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">The Less Quick Version</h2>

    <p class="copy">Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

    <p class="copy">Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

    <p class="copy">Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

    <p class="copy">If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

    <p class="copy">If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they&#39;ll be wearing branded t-shirts.</p>

    <p class="copy">Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

    <p class="copy">We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>

    <p class="copy">Adapted from original at <a href="http://2012.jsconf.us/#/about">http://2012.jsconf.us/#/about</a>, with thanks to DDD Europe.</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">What about diversity?</h2>

    <p class="copy">We are seeking to source and support speakers from underrepresented groups as much as possible in order to provide a richly diverse lineup of perspectives and backgrounds.</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">Accessibility</h2>

    <p class="copy">Our venue provides full wheelchair accessibility, as required by USA federal and Colorado state law. Access to the conference venue is via elevator. If you have special requirements, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you.</p>
